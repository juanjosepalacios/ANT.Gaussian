C     CalDSu is the top-level interface for density functional
C     calculations.  It handles loading common blocks and controlling
C     parallel execution.  However, input matrices should already be
C     cartesian.  /B/ and /RepAll/ should already be loaded.

C
C     This common block is organized in such a manner so as to
C     facilitate the calculation of integrals over Gaussian
C     functions.  Before launching into a description of the various
C     arrays, it will be useful to define the concepts of primitive
c     shells and contracted (or full) shells.
C
C     A primitive shell is defined to be a set of basis functions
C     up to and including functions of some maximum angular
C     quantum number which share a common exponent.  Thus,
C     an L=1 shell would consist of the functions (S,PX,PY,PZ)
C     all with the same gaussian exponent.  Similarly, an L=2
C     shell would contain (S,PX,PY,PZ,XX,YY,ZZ,XY,XZ,YZ) where
C     XX, etc. denote the normalized second-order gaussian
C     functions.
C
C     A full, or contracted shell results from contracting the functions
C     of several primitive shells together.  In typical calculations,
C     one normally uses contracted shells.
C
C     As an example, consider the carbon atom in the 6-31G basis.  In
C     this basis, the carbon will have 10 primitive shells (6+3+1).  The
C     first 6 primitive shells are S-shells (L=0), and are contracted
C     together to make a single S-type basis function.  The next three
C     shells are SP-shells (L=1), each consisting of (S,PX,PY,PZ)
C     functions.  These primitive shells are contracted together to make
C     four atomic orbital basis functions: S, PX, PY and PZ.  The
C     outermost primitive shell is also of SP type, and makes yet another
C     4 atomic orbital basis functions.
C
C     If the program were limited to this definition of shells, one would
C     have to use a set of SP-functions whenever a set of D-functions was
C     desired, for example.  Some way must be devised to avoid this.
C     Thus, we introduce the idea of a 'shell constraint'.  The shell
C     constraint specifies which functions within a shell are actually
C     employed.  By appropriately setting the shell constraint, one can
C     get just the D portion of an L=2 shell.
C
C     In fact, the current code supports only SP shells and shells of
C     one angular momentum.  Hence the only useful shell contraint
C     is for L=1 shells, for which a value of 1 indicates a pure P
C     shell and any other value (typically 2 is used) indicates an
C     S=P shell.
C
C     We now summarize the arrays that appear in Common /B/:
C
C     EXX    ... Contains the Gaussian exponents for all the the
C                primitive shells.  The array ShellA contains pointers
C                into EXX for the various primitive shells.
C     C1     ... Contains the S coefficients for all the primitive shells,
C                indexed by ShellA.
C     C2     ... Contains the P coefficients for all the primitive shells,
C     C3     ... Contains the D coefficients for all the primitive shells,
C                indexed by ShlADF.
C     C4     ... Contains the F and higher coefficients for all the
C                primitive shells, indexed by ShlADF.
C     ShlADF ... Indexing array for contraction coefficients for L>=2.
C     X      ... The X-Cartesian coordinate for each primitive shell.

C                of the data for the Ith contracted shell.
C     ShellN ... ShellN(I) contains the number of primitive Gaussians in
C                the I-th contracted shell.
C     ShellT ... Contains the maximum angular quantum number of shell I.
C     ShellC ... Contains the shell constraint for shell I.  See table below.
C     AOS    ... AOS(I) gives the starting atomic orbital basis function
C                number (i.e. number within the list of atomic orbital
C                basis functions) of shell I.  note that AOS is always
C                filled as though the shell contained all possible
C                lower angular momentum functions.  This array is obsolete
C                and it's use is deprecated.
C     JAnSav ... Used to preserve JAn when treating each shell as a separate
C                center during testing.
C     NShell ... The number of contracted shells.
C     MaxTyp ... The highest angular quantum number present in the basis.
C     I5DB1  ... 0/1 whether d functions are pure/Cartesian
C     I7FB1  ... 0/1 whether f and higher functions are pure/Cartesian
C
C     The following table summarizes the original relationship between
C     ShellT and ShellC.  However, currently ShellC is set to 2 for all
C     shells except P shells, for which it is 1.

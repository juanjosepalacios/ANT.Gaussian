# ANT.Gaussian
New version with implementations of SOC and spin rotations by Wynand Dednam
It also works both with intel and PGI compilers. No need to maintain two versions. Just set your enviroments variables.


ANT.G-2.5.1 is intended to contain the latest changes of Wynand and Palacios already in 2.5.0, now including the evaluation of the polarization. 

I think the issue of the integration of the advanced density matrix is solved. Some care needed when evaluating the Dyson equation
